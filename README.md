# hello-world

I am a sound designer keen to learn more about DSP and audio programming.
I have used Max/MSP in the past and I am now learning Pure Data, and hoping to also teach myself some typed languages.
Specifically I want to learn C# and/or C++ in order to do audio coding within game engines such as Unity and Unreal.
I have some limited experience with programming in C from my days as a physics undergraduate.
I have also played around with ChucK.
Having a Github account seems like a good idea.
Also, open source software is a fantastic initiative that I want to be a part of.
